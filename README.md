## Objective
The objective is to perform all steps of the CRISP-Process in order to develop an good prediction model for the predicting outcomes of Shelter Animal of a shelter
.The implementation is carried out
in KNIME.

## Dataset: 
Intake information such as breed, color, sex and age from the Austin Animal Center.

## Target: 
Predict the outcome (e.g. adoption or
transfer to owner) of the animals as they leave the
Animal Center.

## Project Goals: Data Analysis and Modelling
* Understand the Data!
* Understanding what data is available
* What are challenges given in the data set?
* Which information is missing / which extra information would be helpful?
* Can additional attributes be generated ?
* Why is the chosen model useful ?
